  Your attempts to lift the axe are in vain. It seems to be made for a troll of some kind. And, is therefore much too heavy for you to lift. The dragon stairs at you with the gaze of one of those monsters in human form. Who spend their days writing in evil glee a spiteful reviews of choose your own adventures were violence is not the answer and axes are too big to lift. Dear reader if you ever come across one of those reviews please for your own safety and sanity do not read it. Any way the dragon turns you into a crispy critter. You lose.
