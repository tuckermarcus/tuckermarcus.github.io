<p>
  You feel like different parts of your body are spinning, going through each other, and being turned inside out for no apparent reason. Then you feel like, while all this is happening, you are being sucked through a tube. And you feel a plummeting sort of sensation in the pit of your stomach, or at least where the pit of your stomach was before all this happened. Suddenly you have re-formed and are falling to the ground! Thankfully your fall is cushioned, though not very much, by a pile of gold coins. As you get to your feet, you see that the room is full of piles of the same sort as the one that just interrupted your tumble. YOU WIN!!!
