You enter a room full of treasure. Gold and swords litter the ground, but... it is guarded by a red dragon! A slow growl grows in it's throat, steam blows out of it's nostrils, and you are pretty sure that if you can't beat it you will be toast… literally! Do you <a href="010.html"> give it battle with the giant axe on the ground</a> or <a href="011.html">do you pull the weird wood</a>?
