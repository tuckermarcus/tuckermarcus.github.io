<h1>The guano islands
</h1>
<p>
Saltpeter is also a good fertilizer for crops, because it contains <a href="fixednitrogen.html">fixed nirogen</a>. A little more than a century ago, the most plentiful source of nitrogen was guano &mdash; bat or bird droppings. And the greatest source of guano was found on the Chincha Islands off the coast of Peru. The Chincha Islands &mdash; a group of very bountiful guano islands &mdash; were a major source of income for Peru. Thousands of ships would come to the island to buy the guano, which had become a very popular fertilizer. Despite the amount of money the Chincha Islands produced, barely any Peruvians wanted to work there. So Peru started to "hire" coolies &mdash; Chinese men who were often tricked into signing five-year contracts that basically made them slaves.
